CMake Warning at C:/Program Files/JetBrains/CLion 2024.3/bin/cmake/win/x64/share/cmake-3.30/Modules/CMakeFindDependencyMacro.cmake:76 (find_package):
  By not providing "FindQt6CoreTools.cmake" in CMAKE_MODULE_PATH this project
  has asked CMake to find a package configuration file provided by
  "Qt6CoreTools", but CMake did not find one.

  Could not find a package configuration file provided by "Qt6CoreTools"
  (requested version 6.4.2) with any of the following names:

    Qt6CoreToolsConfig.cmake
    qt6coretools-config.cmake

  Add the installation prefix of "Qt6CoreTools" to CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH or set
  "Qt6CoreTools_DIR" to a directory containing one of the above files.  If
  "Qt6CoreTools" provides a separate development package or SDK, be sure it
  has been installed.

  Found package configuration file:

    C:/Qt/6.4.2/mingw_64/lib/cmake/Qt6WidgetsTools/Qt6WidgetsToolsConfig.cmake

  but it set Qt6WidgetsTools_FOUND to FALSE so package "Qt6WidgetsTools" is
  considered to be NOT FOUND.  Reason given by package:

  Qt6WidgetsTools could not be found because dependency Qt6CoreTools could
  not be found.

  Found package configuration file:

  but it set Qt6Widgets_FOUND to FALSE so package "Qt6Widgets" is considered

  Qt6Widgets could not be found because dependency Qt6WidgetsTools could not
  be found.

  Configuring with --debug-find-pkg=Qt6WidgetsTools might reveal details why
  the package was not found.

  Configuring with -DQT_DEBUG_FIND_PACKAGE=ON will print the values of some
  of the path variables that find_package uses to try and find the package.
